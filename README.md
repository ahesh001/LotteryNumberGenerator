# LotteryNumberGenerator
# What is the project about?
  - This project is based on generating random numbers according to the Mega Millions rules. Although this project does a bit more where it also accounts for the impact of 309 million players. To potentially reduce the chance of sharing the jackpot, my code avoids commonly picked numbers (like numbers 1-31, which represent days of the month).
